# POC: Reactor RabbitMQ

It demonstrates how to publish and consume messages from RabbitMQ broker using Reactor.

The goal is to implement a reactive non-blocking instant messaging app that communicates with the message broker. All configuration should be injected into the service via properties and the communication should follow the direct exchange-to-queue pattern.
